			<h2>
				History</h2>
			<p>University Boxing was started in 2007 to create a community where individuals could meet up and and practice the sport of boxing. No other boxing organization existed in the University of Texas. University Boxing was designed to be a community of learning, and people of all skill levels were to be accepted.</p>
			<p>It started with a few black-and-white flyers created on Microsoft Paint, tacked on to wooden kiosks around campus. The first meeting had about 5 members who had never known each other before.</p>
			<p>The organization slowly grew by word of mouth over the years. Though it had humble beginnings, University Boxing has persisted through the years. It is now a thriving environment for the UT student community, with members helping each other and growing together.</p>
			<p>Hundreds of people have gone through the organization over the years.  More than forty active members now enroll in the club each semester.</p>
